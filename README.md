# Vimrc modules

This repo contains some vimrc modules primarily used in [my .vimrc](https://codeberg.org/LunarWatcher/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc). They're kept separate for reusability, and as an attempt to reduce the already highly monolithic behaviour of my vimrc.

Note that all modules are loaded automatically, and are heavily influenced by personal preference.
